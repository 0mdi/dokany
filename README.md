# Dokany

## Dokany is a Fork of Dokan 0.6.0 synced with DokanX fork
Because the original [Dokan](http://dokan-dev.net/en/docs/) project is no longer maintained.
Because the [DokanX](https://github.com/BenjaminKim/dokanx) fork has undesired changes for our projects.

Dokany is Dokan updated to build with latest build tools, and bug fixes applied from Dokanx. It remains compatible with Dokan legacy code, no missing projects (.net wrapper...), no additional C++ code dependencies, with a clean repository history.
Signed x86 / x64 Windows drivers are also provided at each release.

## To Build
Download and install the [Visual Studio 2013 with WDK 8.1 Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg454513.aspx)

## Contribute
A fork initiative for Dokan is hard work and we don't want to split the small Dokan community. We forked the project again because of undesired changes (our opinion) on DokanX as explained before.

Current project vision is to keep DokanX and Dokany synced. For any pull request on this repository, please also suggest the PR on DokanX repository (if applicable).
